## App Structure 

**Home Ease** is an Android App built using `Kotlin` during the 36-Hour Hackathon **Diversion 2k23**. The App is using the `MVVM Architecture` so that it is easy to make new changes to the app in the future.

* `Selling of services`: This App helps user to help in their daily and compulsory DIY tasks whether it Laundry, cleaning,etc and the MSP of the app is that here users get Puja services , this feature is made especially to catre the needs of Indian. .
* Saving data - User can book the services which he/she would want to have. This data is saved in the app's internal storage using the `ROOM library`
so that the user can view their ordered services in **Offline-mode**.
* App navigation - I have used `Navigation-components` for easily navigating from one fragment to the other without writting the same boilerplate code again and again.
